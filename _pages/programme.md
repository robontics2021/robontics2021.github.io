A zoom link will be made available for people participating online; the link will likely be announced on Thursday the 16th. The Zoom call will be opened just before a session starts.

The location for the RobOntics workshop is yet to be decided in detail but, like other BOSK workshops, will be in a room in either Kolpinghaus Bozen or in the main University building.

For those of you who present a paper in person, there will be a computer in the workshop room that you can use for your presentation if you so prefer. If you instead prefer to use your own laptop, you must connect it to the workshop's Zoom room and to the beamer in the room.

For those of you present on-site, please do not connect to the Zoom room unless you do so for the purpose of holding your presentation. The Zoom call will be projected via the beamer.

And of course, on-site attendees must wear a face mask at all times while indoors.

We look forward to seeing you at the workshop!
